# scMultiome-analysis-with-ArchR
This repository contains code and resources for performing scMultiome analysis using ArchR. The analysis uses common cells from single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data to provide insights into gene expression regulation at the single-cell level.

This script useful while trying to integrate multiple datasets.

## 1. Key Features:
****************************************************************************************************
scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq Integration: Combines single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics data for a comprehensive understanding of gene regulation.

Cell Type Clustering and Annotation: Utilizes clustering techniques to identify and annotate cell types based on multi-omic data.

Visualization: Interactive plots for visualizing gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and their interactions.

Differential Analysis: Identifying key genes and chromatin regions that are differentially accessible across conditions or cell types.
